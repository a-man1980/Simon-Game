Welcome to the Simon Game project! This repository contains the source code for a classic Simon game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<br>
The Simon Game is a fun and challenging memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order. With each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more difficult to remember.
<br>
Javascript is extensively used for building the logic of the game.
